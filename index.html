                  Hey there, I'm Kyle. I'm 14, and I'm a hobbyist game developer, though maybe not a <i>casual</i> one. I like programming, specifically making video games. But, I'm in no need of money right now, and I just want to have a good time making games I would enjoy playing. That's why most of my games are completely free of charge. I'll always accept donations, but don't feel the need to give them. I don't need the money.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So, welcome aboard! Feel free to look around. I've got some useful stuff here. There is some stuff that I don't want to program here, though, so there are a few links that take you out of site to somewhere like <a href = "https://that-one-nerd.itch.io/" target = "_blank">Itch</a>, but I hope one day I'll have all of my games, info, etc, all here to view. We'll see how it goes.

        <div class = "formattable whatido">
            <h2>What kind of stuff do I do?</h2>
            <p>
                I usually program in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target = "_blank">C#</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)" target = "_blank">Unity</a>, and I am the best at those languages, but there are some others I know but am not as fluent in, like <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target = "_blank">C++</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target = "_blank">Python</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, and most recently, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target = "_blank">HTML</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target = "_blank">CSS</a>. This website was the result of those new languages learned. No website builder needed this time! 

                Personally, I have an <i>insistence</i> to make all the code I use myself. I don't like using other people's code for mine. And, especially in C#, that's usually what I'll do. I get the uses of other people writing the code for you, but I still think it's fun to have the same learning experiance in the process, and to end up with code that you understand. There are a few exceptions to that, like <a href = "https://www.newtonsoft.com/json" target = "_blank">Newtonsoft.Json</a>, but who knows, maybe not for long :)

                Well, sorry to disappoint, but I have no interest in learning the stresses of adulthood 4 years early. I do commissions occasionally, and most of them are completely free of charge, but keep in mind that I'm not here to make myself hate programming by doing it nonstop for months (though I still do that, sometimes, on my own wishes), I'm here to make games. Not for a living, for a hobby. So how about you wait a few more years before you introduce another inspired teen to crunch culture.
